# AMModInstaller
Among Us Mod Installer By TheSingleOneYT

# Requirements
```
-Make sure you have Among Us on steam, doesn't work on Epic Games Launcher
-Know where to find Among Us_Data
-Everything from the zip (VERY IMPORTANT)
(Make sure the exe is in the SAME directory (folder) the Modfolder is in)
```

# IMPORTANT

The Among Us Airship map udpate broke modding. UABE broke so mods could not be made, so no mods could be installed.
Thankfully, Github user nesrak1 (https://github.com/nesrak1/) has made a new version of UABE (UABEA) which allows modding
on newer Unity games!

All the mods included in the Modfolder of this AMModInstaller version wouldn't have been possible without UABEA!

Want more information on UABEA, UABE's status? Check out this video I made a couple weeks after the Airship update!

# Extra
```
Got a texture mod of your own?
-Go to the Modfolder directory
-Paste in your mod and call it what the mod is (MAKE SURE IT IS A .ASSETS FILE!!)
-Restart AMModInstaller if you have it open.
-AMModInstaller will automatically detect the new mod and include it on the mod options list!
```
